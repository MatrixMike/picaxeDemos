Debugging the stepper motor picaxe demo board:

apply 12V from SLA battery, the 5V regulator presents voltage to the picaxe via the ribbon cable.
The processor operates and the 7 segment LED display changes.
The Stepper Motor does not operate.

TO CHECK:
<ol>
<li>switches on the picaxe board
</li><li>switches on the motor driver board
</li>
</ol>

the software - since a few days ago I was able to compile the software on Xubuntu laptop via Fritzing.
I have created a github repo to hold any code generated - for posterity. It was originally generated before I did my teacher training on a WIN XP (I think) machine - various forms of the source are still around, check the source on Dell desktop.
